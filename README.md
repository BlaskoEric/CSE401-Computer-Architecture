# CSE401-Computer-Architecture
CSE401 Computer Architecture
With Dr. Gomez

## Labs (MIPS)

### Lab 1
* Fetch stage of the MIPS architecture. Includes memory, incremntor, 
program counter, mux and first fetch/decode latch. 

### Lab 2
* Decode stage of the MIPS architecture. Includes previous components,
control, registers, sign extendor and decode/execution latch. 

### Lab 3
* Execution stage of the MIPS architecture. Includes previous components,
ALU, ALU control, adder, bottom mux and execution/memory latch.

### Lab 4
* Memory stage of the MIPS architecture. Includes previous components,
data, and gate, data memory, memory and memory/write back latch.

### Lab 5
* Write back stage of the MIPS architecture. Includes previous components and
reuses the mux comonent.

### Lab 6
* Contains all stages of the MIPS architecture. This lab was to test the
full functionality of the pipeline by using test input.
